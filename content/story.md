## Our Mission

Our mission is to be the one-stop shop for powering your non-profit's mission. We provide the technical support that nonprofits need to thrive and succeed by providing web hosting, technical consulting, and development resources. Check out our [programs page](/programs) for services we offer.

<!-- Our mission is to provide the support other nonprofits need to thrive and succeed be providing web hosting, technical consulting, and development resources. We believe in empowering organizations to focus on their core missions while we handle their technical challenges. -->

## Our Beginning

NPTS was founded in Spring of 2024 by three close friends with shared passions for technology and community service. All three founders of NPTS are alumni of the University of Texas at Dallas and dedicated supporters of the program that they met each other through, [UTDesignâ€™s Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS)](https://epics.utdallas.edu). Two of the founders hold PhDs in engineering disciplines and one is highly experienced in start-up, web development and design, and non-profit spaces. While spending weeknights supporting and mentoring EPICS students working to design technical solutions for local non-profits, the three founders saw a gap in the support and technical maintenance services available to nonprofits and decided to create a solution that bridges technology and community service: NPTS. Within a few months of its inception, NPTS has already partnered with several nonprofits, providing them with essential technical support and resources that they need to power their mission. See our [partners page](/partners) to learn about the great partners we work with.

In 2024, they decided to dedicate their time and expertise to establish NPTS, aiming to serve other nonprofits in need. Within a few months of its inception, NPTS had already partnered with several nonprofits, providing them with essential technical support and resources. The support and resources come in the form of hosting and maintaining web applications created by students of the [UTDesign EPICS](https://epics.utdallas.edu) program, which allows students to gain real-world experience while contributing to meaningful projects. Previously, these projects would be handed off to nonprofit partners without ongoing support, but NPTS ensures their continued upkeep and improvement while also removing the burden of upkeep from future students. -->

## Our Future

NPTS hopes to give undergraduate students the opportunity to learn and grow through internships. This will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of the technical requirements of maintaining complex web applications and build their skills as programmers while also giving back to their local community and improving the experience of nonprofit organizations using these applications.
