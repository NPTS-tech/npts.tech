## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide the support other non-profits need to thrive and succeed be providing web hosting, technical consulting, and development resources. We believe in empowering organizations to focus on their core missions while we handle their technical challenges.

## Our Beginning

NPTS was started by three friends with shared passions for technology and community service. They saw a gap in the support available to non-profits and decided to create a solution that bridges technology and community service. In 2024, they decided to dedicate their time and expertise to establish NPTS, aiming to serve other non-profits in need. Within a few months of its inception, NPTS had already partnered with several non-profits, providing them with essential technical support and resources. The support and resources come in the form of hosting and maintaining web applications created by students of the [UTDesign EPICS](https://epics.utdallas.edu) program, which allows students to gain real-world experience while contributing to meaningful projects. Previously, these projects would be handed off to non-profit partners without ongoing support, but NPTS ensures their continued upkeep and improvement while also removing the burden of upkeep from future students.

## Our Future

NPTS hopes to give undergraduate students the opportunity to learn and grow through internships. This will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of the technical requirements of maintaining complex web applications and build their skills as programmers while also giving back to their local community and improving the experience of non-profit organizations using these applications.
